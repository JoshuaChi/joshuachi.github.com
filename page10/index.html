				<a href="/en/2009/07/26/redirect-a-page-with-meta-tag.html"><h1 class="title">Redirect a page with meta tag</h1></a>
				
				<p>I have never imaged it can be so simple to redirect a page.</p>

<p><strong>&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="600"&gt;</strong></p>

<p>&lt;meta&gt; - This is the HTML tag. It belongs in the <head> of your HTML document. You can learn more about the meta tag in my tag library.</p>

<p>http-equiv="refresh" - This attribute tells the browser that this meta tag is sending an HTTP command rather than a standard meta tag. Refresh is an actual HTTP header used by the Web server. It tells the server that the page is going to be reloaded or sent somewhere else.</p>

<p>content="600" - This is the amount of time, in seconds, until the browser should reload the current page.</p>

<p><strong>
&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2;url=http://freetofeel.com"&gt;
</strong>
content="2;url=http://freetofeel.com/" - The number is the time, in seconds, until the page should be redirected. Then, separated by a semi-colon (;) is the URL that should be loaded.</p>

<p><em>Meta refresh tags have some drawbacks:</em>
    * If the redirect happens quickly (less than 2-3 seconds), readers with older browsers can't hit the "Back" button. This is a usability problem.
    * If the redirect happens quickly and goes to a non-existant page, your readers won't be able to hit the "Back" button. This is a usability problem that will cause people to completely leave your site.
    * Refreshing the current page can confuse people. If they didn't request the reload, some people can get concerned about security.</p>

				<a href="/en/2009/07/25/website-promotion.html"><h1 class="title">Website promotion</h1></a>
				
				<p>I try to gather all the website promotion techniques together here. Of course, I am not the original author of them. They are all widely used and are almost deserted as the techniques changes. So don't rely on a method or two method. As a beginner, we should learn the philosophy principles in them and make more thinking.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Article Writing</strong></li>
Article writing is still a useful traffic generator and promotion method. In recent times article marketing has changed. Google no longer appears to use all the backlinks from the same article submitted to multiple directories. So you only really benefit in terms of backlinks when someone reprints your article. This also provides the potential for additional direct traffic. A good strategy is to submit your unique article to one directory. Get it approved and then submit it to others at regular intervals.
    <li><strong>Writing Articles For Other Websites</strong></li>
This is a really useful strategy which is often overlooked. Most website owners are looking for unique content so if you offer to provide them with a totally unique article just for their site so they are unlikely to turn you down. In return all you require is a couple of backlinks to your website from within the article. This way you get to select the all important link text. If you choose quality websites with good page rank and traffic you get the best of both worlds. The best way to get this to work is to publish a couple of good articles on ezinearticles.com and then wait to see who reprints them. Get in touch with the website owner and offer them another article which this time will be exclusive to them.
    <li><strong>Off-Site Blog Posting</strong></li>
Pick some relevant blogs that pass page rank and start posting useful comments to them on a regular basis. Make your comments really useful even if you have to spend time researching. After a while just ask the blog owner if they would allow you to write a couple of posts on their site. They will not often refuse such an offer.
    <li><strong>On Site Blog Posting</strong></li>
If you don’t have your own blog, you need one. Set up a blog along side your existing website. Then write a post every other day about something relevant. If you blog is set up correctly then new posts will be found very quickly (within hours) by the search engines. Remember to write your posts with your keywords in mind. A blog post with a keyword rich title that contains a link back to your main site is worth having and will generate search traffic.
    <li><strong>Web 2.0 Sites</strong></li>
You can generate your own off-site pages for free by using Squidoo, Hubpages and wetpaint to name just three. Build these with content from your main site and articles but rewritten to make it unique. Then include a few links back to your main site. Do not over do the backlinks remember to keep it looking natural.
    <li><strong>advertising</strong></li>
There are many ways of advertising types, in accordance with the media to distinguish between the media, including network, television, books, etc., we can make use of these advertising media to promote our website in order to improve the click-through rate.
    <li><strong>e-mail to promote</strong></li>
E-mail to those rankings and better and our own business has a long association’s Web site to send e-mail request to exchange links, so that we can appear in the link of the website others in order to improve traffic. When the name It also requires us to e-mail designed to attract, at the same time we must have the actual content of sites, and contains a certain amount of original works, to attract visitors attention.
    <li><strong>Links</strong></li>
Recommendations and their own business operations of companies to establish mutual links to each other to engage in well-known.
    <li><strong>Yellow Pages Registration</strong></li>
Some well-known in the Yellow Pages company search website on the Companies Registry, the company added to the enterprise database, so the aim is to not only improve the chances of being searched, and more conducive for companies to promote and raise awareness
    <li><strong><a href="http://www.unblockspace.net/browse.php?u=Oi8vd3d3LnByb21vdGlvbndvcmxkLmNvbS9zZS9hcnRpY2xlcy9hcnRpY2xlLzA5MDcxNS1Bbi1JbnRyby10by1Tb2NpYWwtTWVkaWEtTWFya2V0aW5n&b=5">An Intro to Social Media Marketing</a></strong></li>

<p>In my opinion, to improve the quality of your site is the king.</p>

				<a href="/en/2009/07/21/generate-a-friendly-urls-for-your-site.html"><h1 class="title">Generate a friendly URLS for your site</h1></a>
				
				<p>'We are fighting with SEO everyday ...'
It is true! If you want Google 'know' more about you, it is time to give a friendly URLS to him.
There are two main method that we can make a friendly URLS for our site. And we will take blog as example:
1. The simple way
Append a friendly title after your original URL.
e.g.
Your original post url : <strong>http://xxx.com/blog/1254</strong>
After appending the post title after the original title, it will looks like <strong>http://xxx.com/blog/1254/blog_post_title_about_iron_man</strong>
But there is a disadvantage of this. It would look like blog_post_title_about_iron_man is a sub-item of 1254 for search engines. You can take <a href="http://twitter.com/felixge">Felix</a>'s <a href="http://debuggable.com/posts/dessert-11-welcome-back-friendly-urls:480f4dd5-8dac-414b-b329-4dd5cbdd56cb">post</a> as an example. I think it will be possible to modify the url like what you want, no matter which framework you are using.</p>

<ol>
<li>The final solution
You can take wordpress article as an example. If you take a look at your wordpress database, there is a column named 'url' in posts table. Yes, it is the solution. What you need to do is generating a unique url for every post in your table. It is the same thing we generate an id for every record in our table. You can take the method 'getUniqueUrl' in article <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/adding-friendly-urls-to-the-cake-blog-tutorial">'Adding friendly URLs to The Cake Blog Tutorial'</a> for example.</li>
</ol>


<p>I believe it will not take you half an hour to give a friendly URLS for your website. Why not give a try? :-]</p>

<li><p>If you turn on cache in core.php, everytime when you modify your model , don't forget to clear the files under /tmp/cache/models/.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't cache the element which has include the pagination logic. Because the sort and pagination will fail to work.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is anonymous role in your ACL model, don't divide your ACL model like this:
All --
-----Anonymous
-----Member--
---------------Admin
---------------Normal</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/cdc817b4ee5de4d5/824fccaad92bfca6?hl=en&lnk=gst&q=use+Auth+component+in+AppController%3F#">thread</a> explained this.</p>

<p>The following will be fine:
All --
-----Member--
---------------Admin
---------------Normal</p>

<p>If you want 'post/view' page can be visited by anonymous user, just add it into $this->Auth->allowedActions = array(//....);</p>

<ol>
<li>If you want to use Auth component, you should decide you will use it entirely in your application or use it a little.
For example, If you want to implement your ACL like cake <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/641/Simple-Acl-controlled-Application">demo</a>. You should remember, there is no need to write users/login action code. Cake will help you do the left including login and redirect, if you has set the auth property.</li>
</ol>


<pre name="code" class="php">
    $this->Auth->allowedActions = array(//...);
    $this->Auth->loginAction = array('controller' => 'controller_a', 'action' => 'action_a');
    $this->Auth->loginRedirect = array('controller' => 'controller_b', 'action' => 'action_b');
    $this->Auth->loginError = 'Username and password do not match. Please try again.';
    $this->Auth->fields = array(
     //...
    );
    $this->Auth->allowedControllers = array(//...);

</pre>


<p>And I think Miles <a href="http://www.milesj.me/blog/read/5/using-cakephps-auth-component">post</a> will help you a lot.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you want to send email through Gmail, take a look at this <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cake-php/browse_thread/thread/8573140b2e72d1aa/839b6f576077ed18?hl=en&lnk=gst&q=Need+Help+of+Email+component+-+fail+to+send+email#839b6f576077ed18">thread</a>. And Marc has wrote an <a href="http://marcgrabanski.com/article/cakephp-email-google-apps-gmail">article</a> to implement this in another way.</p></li>
<li><p>It is easy to customize all the error pages, copying the files you needed under cake\libs\view\errors into app\views\errors. And then you can customize it to what you want.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimize your site performance
I don't want to write a lot about this. Because you can find there are a lot of resources[1] about this.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>My favorite is <a href="http://twittergadget.appspot.com/">Gmail Gadget</a> for its simple power that can break through the GFW in China.
Let me introduce the steps to set <a href="http://twittergadget.appspot.com/">Gmail Gadget</a> in Gmail.</p>

<p>Step1: Click the lab icon in Gmail home page
<img src="http://www.freetofeel.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/step1.gif" alt="step1" title="step1" width="550" height="82" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-76" /></p>

<p>Step 2: Enable the 'Add any gadget by URL' widget
&lt;img src="http://www.freetofeel.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/step2.gif" alt="step2" title="step2" width="683" height="128" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-77"</p>

<p>Step 3: Go to Gmail home page -> settings ->Gadgets
Enter <strong>https://twittergadget.appspot.com/gadget-gmail.xml</strong> at the gadget URL.</p>

<p>Step 4: After you add the gadget URL, you will find a twitter widget appeared in the left of your home page.
<img src="http://www.freetofeel.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/step3.gif" alt="step3" title="step3" width="172" height="132" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80" /></p>

<p>The last step is just verifying your twitter account.
And then you can enjoy it with its simple and powerful.
