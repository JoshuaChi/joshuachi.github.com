It's the first time that my domain can not be resolved for around 6 hours. I learned <a href='http://www.godaddy.com'>godaddy</a> DNS was blocked in China sometimes.

This is what I hate to work on a Chinese site. After several minutes struggle, I decide to move my dns from <a href='http://www.godaddy.com'>godaddy</a> to <a href='https://www.dnspod.cn/'>dnspod</a>.

<a href='https://www.dnspod.cn/'>dnspod</a> did really a nice work. No matter the user interfaces or the services. All of them  meet my requirements. 

I don't want to repeat how to setup the dnspod. <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=dns+godaddy+dnspod&oq=dns+godaddy+dnspod&sugexp=chrome,mod=1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8'>google search</a> will tell you more about this.

Now I will just wait for the new dns takes affect. Actaully dns was solved quickly in China, but not in JiangSu province in my testing. Good luck to my <a href='http://www.dachebang.com'>www.dachebang.com</>.
