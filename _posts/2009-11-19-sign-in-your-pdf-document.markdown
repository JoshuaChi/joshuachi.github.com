Have you ever succeed to sign in a PDF file?
Today I try several methods of <a href="http://www.labnol.org/software/sign-pdf-documents/9333/">How to Sign Documents Electronically â€“ No Ink or Paper Required></a>. 
1. 
I try to make an image signature at <a href="http://www.mylivesignature.com/mls_sigdraw.php">MyLiveSignature</a>. And then download it into my local machine;
Try to convert my PDF file to word file via <a href="http://www.pdftoword.com/">web service</a>.
And then upload the doc file and attached the signature image at the right place. Save it as PDF file again.
The PDF file will be messed through this way. So I suggest the second way, easier and faster.

2.

Upload you PDF file ask signature and get the signature document.
