1. <a href="http://www.shinguz.ch/MySQL/mysql_mv.html">Materialised Views with MySQL</a></li> -
I gave a simple test as this '<a href="Materialized view makes login process 25k times faster">article</a>'. 10 times faster in my case.
Before: 56 ms;
After: 6ms;
But the disadvantage of this is the data on the site will not be real time. So if you want to use method to speed up your site, it depends on what business of this page is.

2.

3.

4.
