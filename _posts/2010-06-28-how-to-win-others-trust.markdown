title: "How to win others trust"
---

I just want to post some suggestions about 'trust' from my experience. It might not be perfect, but I am sure some of them are mostly useful for you.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust">Trust (social sciences), reliance on another person or entity. Having faith in others and believing them.</a>

<ul>	
	<li><strong>Be polite.</strong> Only when you respect the others, you can get the respect from the others. Only when you get respect, then it is possible for you to get the 'trust'.</li>
	<li><strong>Trust is not two-way.</strong> It doesn't mean if you trust somebody, somebody should also trust on you. But for sure they will try to trust you firstly. And then if you break the trust from this guy, it will difficulty for you to get it back.</li>
	<li><strong>Trust is hard to copy.</strong> If you didn't know how to be honest man, you will break it at sometime.</li>
	<li><strong>Think before you say.</strong> When somebody ask you something seriously, please think it for a while and then make the reply. If you don't know, you can try to give some references or just say 'no'. Don't waste the others' time and the time of yourself.</li>
	<li><strong>Contribute to the others.</strong> Try to share something or give some help for the others. Don't live in the world with yourself.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep your promise.</strong> If you lost your promise for the others several times and everybody knows you didn't try your best, you will lost the trust forever.</li>
	<li><strong>Try to say 'sorry'. Don't always say 'sorry'.</strong> When you lost your promise, try to say sorry and give a reasonable explanation, rather than ignore it. But..but don't always say sorry for the same mistake.</li>
	<li><strong>Undertake your mistake.</strong> If you make something wrong in your group, please undertake the mistake, rather than hide it. If you think the others might be stupid, you will be the stupid one.</li>

</ul>
