Just learned an interesting point from <a href='http://architects.dzone.com/articles/balancing-software'>'balance software' post</a>:
<h4>When Scrum has died</h4>
<pre>
  In the journey of dramatic improvements to bring your code base under control, there are few things that you should take notice off.

  * An architecture will emerge that supports the design of the resident parts.  Things fit together sweetly and each part supports the other part in symbiotic relationships.
  * The code base will get smaller and the team will shrink to, perhaps,  just 2 or 3 people.
  * Each developer will take on greater responsibility and will find it difficult to break core principles.  The act of living those principles will result in a values that don't need to be listed on a poster on the wall.
  * The scrum master will become redundant.
  * The product owner will do more by working directly with the developers.
  * The developers will represent the interest of their customers directly.
  * The bottleneck will shift from development to the product owner and eventually the customer.

In my opinion, Scrum is used for company to delivery features to users quickly and interactively. As a team, with scrum you can easily prove your works after a short time. You don't have to wait for one year or longer. And big feature and be split into small ones. Everyone know what need to be done in following weeks. You don't have to write so many documents to trace what's going on. Ideally, as the authors said, if the code base can be made smaller and smaller. And all the new feature is just a plugin to your code. Of course you don't need scrum. Should we call this factory model? As workers(developers) just need to collect the feature request and compose it by some existing functions. And plug it into the platform(codebase). I have not seen a company who has such a powerful platform. And I guess the bottleneck will be the platform itself then.
