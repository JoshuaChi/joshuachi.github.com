title: Try to Use Github Pages As My Blog
---


Finally, I decide to move my blog to githubpages. I know github do a great job. I want to give a try.
Later I will try to import my old blog entries.
Until now, everything looks amazing.

I finished the import from wordpress blog to github. I make a import.php script. Don't forget to change the user name, password and database in this script.

Add <a href='http://disqus.com'>comment service</a> into my blog.
