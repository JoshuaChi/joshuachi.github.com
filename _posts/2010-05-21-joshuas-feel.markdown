1. Important VS Urgent
In everyone's life, there are urgent things and important things. You will feel pressure if there are a lot of urgent things. And you will pick urgent things before starting the important ones. But have you think about this logic? Sometimes the urgent things are caused by the important ones. Taking exercises is important thing for your healthy. But if you get sick, that will be the urgent thing. But if you pay more attention to the important things, may be you will not get sick. This is the logic!
So pay more attention to the important ones, which will save you a lot of time.
