1.
Estimates can be better done by the people who have the experience of similar kind of work already done, Peers and Historical data. It is always better to involve the people who have similar work experience for appropriate estimations. 

2.
No one will estimate perfectly for the first time, for sure team members will either over estimate or under estimate the task work, but it makes them realize how much they can produce and for next sprint the team members will try to estimate a bit more precisely.

3.
After three to four sprints, team members will be in a position to understand their own strength and how much work they can do. This leads for better estimates.
