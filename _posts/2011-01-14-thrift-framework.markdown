Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services development.
Now it supports C++, C#, Erlang, Haskell, Java, Objective C/Cocoa, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Squeak.

    * Download: <a href='http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/download/'>http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/download/</a>
    * Install: <a href='http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/GettingUbuntuPackages'>http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/GettingUbuntuPackages</a>

So basically, what you need to do is define a .thrift definition file. And Thrift will help you generate the RPC client and RPC server. There are a lot of examples in this <a href='http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/'>wiki</a> page.

You can use this <a href='http://chanian.com/2010/05/13/thrift-tutorial-a-php-client/'>demo</a> to understand how it works.

There is a similar project called <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/'>Protocol Buffers</a> which provided by google.

This is what I have done in todays' Innovation Day. And I totall agree:
<pre>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</pre>
<br />
We know people is the kernel in a technical company. Anything is beneficial for people should be encouraged. But of course, it also should be beneficial for company firstly. Any rule that restrict people's mind should be removed.
