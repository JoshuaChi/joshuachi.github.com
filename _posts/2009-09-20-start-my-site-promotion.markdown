<p style="line-height: 1.7em; text-align: justify;">Human is a powerful machine for website promotion. If you have 20 people and 20 computers located in 20 different cities, you can do incredible things like:</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.7em; text-align: justify;">1.Exposure: There will be 5000 advertising posts all over the websites in 24 hours, if each person copy and paste the same posts.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.7em; text-align: justify;">2. Traffic: Each person uses a small program to clear cookie, redial ADSL(Ip address will be changed) , and visit your website once every 2 minutes, then you can reach 14,000 unique visits each day. Very high traffic for startup websites.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.7em; text-align: justify;">3.Video marketing: Each person uses a small program to replay your video once every 6 seconds, then you can reach 12,000 views in one hour, and get it into the most popular video list.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.7em; text-align: justify;">4. Make rivals crazy: With the same trick, 20 PCs from 20 cities automatically refresh your rivalsâ€™ websites 24 hours a day(remember to change your IP and clear cookie once every 5 minutes), they will kill themselves.</p>
