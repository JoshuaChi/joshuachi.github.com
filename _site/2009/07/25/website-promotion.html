    <h3 class="title"><a href="/2009/07/25/website-promotion.html">Website promotion</a></h3>
    <p>I try to gather all the website promotion techniques together here. Of course, I am not the original author of them. They are all widely used and are almost deserted as the techniques changes. So don't rely on a method or two method. As a beginner, we should learn the philosophy principles in them and make more thinking.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Article Writing</strong></li>
Article writing is still a useful traffic generator and promotion method. In recent times article marketing has changed. Google no longer appears to use all the backlinks from the same article submitted to multiple directories. So you only really benefit in terms of backlinks when someone reprints your article. This also provides the potential for additional direct traffic. A good strategy is to submit your unique article to one directory. Get it approved and then submit it to others at regular intervals.
    <li><strong>Writing Articles For Other Websites</strong></li>
This is a really useful strategy which is often overlooked. Most website owners are looking for unique content so if you offer to provide them with a totally unique article just for their site so they are unlikely to turn you down. In return all you require is a couple of backlinks to your website from within the article. This way you get to select the all important link text. If you choose quality websites with good page rank and traffic you get the best of both worlds. The best way to get this to work is to publish a couple of good articles on ezinearticles.com and then wait to see who reprints them. Get in touch with the website owner and offer them another article which this time will be exclusive to them.
    <li><strong>Off-Site Blog Posting</strong></li>
Pick some relevant blogs that pass page rank and start posting useful comments to them on a regular basis. Make your comments really useful even if you have to spend time researching. After a while just ask the blog owner if they would allow you to write a couple of posts on their site. They will not often refuse such an offer.
    <li><strong>On Site Blog Posting</strong></li>
If you don’t have your own blog, you need one. Set up a blog along side your existing website. Then write a post every other day about something relevant. If you blog is set up correctly then new posts will be found very quickly (within hours) by the search engines. Remember to write your posts with your keywords in mind. A blog post with a keyword rich title that contains a link back to your main site is worth having and will generate search traffic.
    <li><strong>Web 2.0 Sites</strong></li>
You can generate your own off-site pages for free by using Squidoo, Hubpages and wetpaint to name just three. Build these with content from your main site and articles but rewritten to make it unique. Then include a few links back to your main site. Do not over do the backlinks remember to keep it looking natural.
    <li><strong>advertising</strong></li>
There are many ways of advertising types, in accordance with the media to distinguish between the media, including network, television, books, etc., we can make use of these advertising media to promote our website in order to improve the click-through rate.
    <li><strong>e-mail to promote</strong></li>
E-mail to those rankings and better and our own business has a long association’s Web site to send e-mail request to exchange links, so that we can appear in the link of the website others in order to improve traffic. When the name It also requires us to e-mail designed to attract, at the same time we must have the actual content of sites, and contains a certain amount of original works, to attract visitors attention.
    <li><strong>Links</strong></li>
Recommendations and their own business operations of companies to establish mutual links to each other to engage in well-known.
    <li><strong>Yellow Pages Registration</strong></li>
Some well-known in the Yellow Pages company search website on the Companies Registry, the company added to the enterprise database, so the aim is to not only improve the chances of being searched, and more conducive for companies to promote and raise awareness
