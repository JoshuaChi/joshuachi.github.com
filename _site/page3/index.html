				<p>I just want to post some suggestions about 'trust' from my experience. It might not be perfect, but I am sure some of them are mostly useful for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust">Trust (social sciences), reliance on another person or entity. Having faith in others and believing them.</a></p>

<ul>    
    <li><strong>Be polite.</strong> Only when you respect the others, you can get the respect from the others. Only when you get respect, then it is possible for you to get the 'trust'.</li>
    <li><strong>Trust is not two-way.</strong> It doesn't mean if you trust somebody, somebody should also trust on you. But for sure they will try to trust you firstly. And then if you break the trust from this guy, it will difficulty for you to get it back.</li>
    <li><strong>Trust is hard to copy.</strong> If you didn't know how to be honest man, you will break it at sometime.</li>
    <li><strong>Think before you say.</strong> When somebody ask you something seriously, please think it for a while and then make the reply. If you don't know, you can try to give some references or just say 'no'. Don't waste the others' time and the time of yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Contribute to the others.</strong> Try to share something or give some help for the others. Don't live in the world with yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your promise.</strong> If you lost your promise for the others several times and everybody knows you didn't try your best, you will lost the trust forever.</li>
    <li><strong>Try to say 'sorry'. Don't always say 'sorry'.</strong> When you lost your promise, try to say sorry and give a reasonable explanation, rather than ignore it. But..but don't always say sorry for the same mistake.</li>
    <li><strong>Undertake your mistake.</strong> If you make something wrong in your group, please undertake the mistake, rather than hide it. If you think the others might be stupid, you will be the stupid one.</li>

</ul>

				<ul>
    <li>You can avoid the filesort by making order by column appear in the where clause</li>

    <li>When using join, make sure the left side join table column is used in the ORDER BY clause or change the join type</li>
</ul>

				<p>Problem: There is always a black border for every window in a cracked mac, including 'Finder', 'Terminal', even the icon on the desktop.</p>

<p>Solution: Delete 'com.apple.universalaccess.plist' in /Usr/$YOURNAME/Library/Preferences/. And then Logout and login.</p>

<p>It can fixed in my cracked mac machine.
And the main idea was back up your mac preferences</p>

<pre name='code' class='css'>
cp -R /Usr/$YOURNAME/Library/Preferences/ /Usr/$YOURNAME/backup/
</pre>


<p>And then when you login again, the preferences will be recreated again, like a new user.
For you, you just try to copy some plist from /Usr/$YOURNAME/backup/ to /Usr/$YOURNAME/Library/Preferences/. And then you can check which plist file was the fail reason</p>

<li><p>Important VS Urgent
In everyone's life, there are urgent things and important things. You will feel pressure if there are a lot of urgent things. And you will pick urgent things before starting the important ones. But have you think about this logic? Sometimes the urgent things are caused by the important ones. Taking exercises is important thing for your healthy. But if you get sick, that will be the urgent thing. But if you pay more attention to the important things, may be you will not get sick. This is the logic!
So pay more attention to the important ones, which will save you a lot of time.</p></li>

				<ol>
<li><p>Estimates can be better done by the people who have the experience of similar kind of work already done, Peers and Historical data. It is always better to involve the people who have similar work experience for appropriate estimations.</p></li>
<li><p>No one will estimate perfectly for the first time, for sure team members will either over estimate or under estimate the task work, but it makes them realize how much they can produce and for next sprint the team members will try to estimate a bit more precisely.</p></li>
<li><p>After three to four sprints, team members will be in a position to understand their own strength and how much work they can do. This leads for better estimates.</p></li>

				<h3 class="title"><a href="/2010/04/15/be-careful-when-using-propel-build-schema.html">Be careful when using propel-build-schema</a></h3>
				
				<p>Tip1:
The generated schema.yml will has the duplicated table when you are using propel-build-schema to generate the yml file based on Symfony Version 1.</p>

<pre class='yml' name='code'>
propel:
  duplicated_table_name:
</pre>


<p>Tip 2:
In config/propel.ini, the propel.database means the database engine.</p>

<pre class='php' name='code'>
propel.database            = mysql
</pre>
