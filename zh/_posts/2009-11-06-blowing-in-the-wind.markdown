    How many roads must a man walk down  一个人要经历多长的旅途

    Before they call him a man  才能成为真正的男人

    How many seas must a white dove sail  鸽子要飞跃几重大海

    Before she sleeps in the sand  才能在沙滩上安眠

    How many times must the cannon balls fly 要多少炮火

    Before they’re forever banned  才能换来和平

    The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind  那答案，我的朋友，飘零在风中

    The answer is blowing in the wind  答案随风飘逝

    How many years must a mountain exist  山峰要屹立多久

    Before it is washed to the sea  才是沧海桑田

    How many years can some people exist  人们要等待多久

    Before they’re allowed to be free  才能得到自由

    How many times can a man turn his head  一个人要季度回首

    And pretend that he just doesn’t see  才能视而不见

    The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind 那答案，我的朋友，在风中飘零

    The answer is blowing in the wind  答案随风而逝

    How many times must a man look up  一个人要仰望多少次

    Before he can see the sky 才能见苍穹

    How many ears must one man have  一个人要多么善听

    Before he can hear people cry  才能听见他人的呐喊

    How many deaths will it take  多少生命要陨落

    ‘Till he knows that too many people have died  才知道那已故的众生

    The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind  答案，我的朋友，在风中飘零

    The answer is blowing in the wind 答案随风而逝
