We known Google announced its <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">web OS</a> based on Chrome. As I have discussed this about two years ago with my colleagues, Web OS is the trending of the Operation System. What we need is a machine without hard disk, just strongest CPU and a network port. All the files, maybe we will call it data in Web OS era, will be stored in a data center. Every time when we start our machine, the Web OS opened. What we will do is remote. Calculation is remote, Storage is remote and Service is remote. I think the Cloud will be part of the data center at that time. There will be computer concept. What we needed is just an end point. Everything became simple , effective and worldwide shared.
